## Gameplay

The main gameplay features two characters in an open stage fighting against each other. Each character has light and heavy punch and kick attacks, and has standing, crouching, and jumping variations. Some attacks will knock your opponent back, and some will simply leave them in hitstun. Blocking attacks can be done by holding back on the controller.
